#	Can you summarize your observation about the time series from the summary stats and box plot? 
#Boxplots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles. Based on the summary stats and box plot, we can easily locate the minimum as well as maximum value of the median house price. 142900 is the minimum value whereas 373100 is the maximum value.The average price of House in NJ is around 263499. There are no outliers in the data set as visible in the plot.
#For the boxplot of train data, there are some outliers.

#•	For which month is the value of time series high and for which month is it low?
max(ValueComp2$figure) #August highest
min(ValueComp2$figure) #April lowest
#The value is highest in june and lowest in january
#•	Can you think of the reason behind the value being high in those months and low in those months?
#Typically, the house prices will go down in winter months because there are less buyers on the market.Based on the demand from buyers and their purchasing behaviour, the values are lowest in january colder month and while in summer, as the demand increases for the people to purchase, go out and visit the house prices also increase.

#•	Show the plot for time series adjusted for seasonality. Overlay this with the line for actual time series? Does seasonality have big fluctuations to the value of time series?
